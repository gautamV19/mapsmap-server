Crowdsource and crowdfund collaboration on maps of problems 

Creating a fun app to open source collaboration on maps of problems (Miro-style) through crowdsourcing (Wikipedia-style) and crowdfunding (Kickstarter-style).

Individuals and communities will use it to coordinate on their local problems, such as matters.global's problem maps, or Foresight's longevity tech tree.

Others will use the app to incentivize desirable trajectories through the problem spaces, as described in Trent McConaghyâ€™s Starships & Tokens, or Balaji Srinivasan's Tech Tree.
